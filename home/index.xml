      <description>Implement a simple video processing application in LITMUSRTLink Technology: C | Linux | FFmpeg
 Applied LITMUSRT to evaluate the performance of real-time scheduling (PSN-EDF, P-FP, C-EDF and GSN-EDF). Implemented simple video as an input source, designed C program to link FFmpeg and LITMUSRT for decoding. Proved that average lateness and response time of PSN-EDF and P-FP were lower than others by 29.6% and 3.52%.
