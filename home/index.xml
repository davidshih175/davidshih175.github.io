      <description>Implement a simple video processing application in LITMUSRTLink Technology: C | Linux | FFmpeg
 Applied LITMUSRT to evaluate the performance of real-time scheduling (PSN-EDF, P-FP, C-EDF and GSN-EDF). Implemented simple video as an input source, designed C program to link FFmpeg and LITMUSRT for decoding. Proved that average lateness and response time of PSN-EDF and P-FP were lower than others by 29.6% and 3.52%.

      <description>The Study of Fabrication and Tribological Properties of Rubber Based Friction MaterialLink Advised by Prof. Chien-Ping Ju, Master Thesis, NCKU, Jul 2012
 Investigated the effects of diverse fabrication parameters (heating rate of post-cured、molding pressure、temperature of post-cured and molding temperature) on tribological properties of Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR)-based friction material. The mechanical properties, tribological properties, and microstructure of NBR based friction material are measured by Shore-type hardness tester, sliding wear tester, surface roughness tester and scanning electron microscopy.</description>
